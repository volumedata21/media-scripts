## How to Use
Download the dbdisc_rename.py file. You can ignore movie and tv, but they are there in case the dbdisc_rename.py file doesn't work. Then just use the command ```python3 dbdisc_rename.py``` and the script will work.

You may need to run the following command to install all dependencies for the script to work:

```
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ffmpeg **
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4
```
